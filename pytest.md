  * Running pytest without mentioning a filename will run all files of format **test\_\*.py** or **\*\_test.py** in the current directory and subdirectories.
  * Pytest requires the test function names to start with **test**. Function names which are not of format **test\*** are not considered as test functions by pytest.
* Executing all test files using `pytest â€“v`.

* Execute tests by substring matching `pytest -k <substring> -v`.
* Execute tests based on markers `pytest -m <marker_name> -v`.
* Creating fixtures using `@pytest.fixture`.
* `conftest.py` allows accessing fixtures from multiple files.
* Parametrizing tests using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
* Xfailing tests using `@pytest.mark.xfail`.
* Skipping tests using `@pytest.mark.skip`.
* Stop test execution on n failures using `pytest --maxfail = <num>`.
* Running tests in parallel using `pytest -n <num>`.
* Generating results xml using `pytest -v --junitxml = "result.xml"`.
